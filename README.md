halide-excursions
=================

A Halide journey taken for pleasure, this repo will hopefully serve as collection of Halide imaging functions that are useful to the community.

The halide-excursions project is an attempt to create a large, open source repository of Halide computer-vision, computational-photography, and image processing functions.  Anyone and everyone is more than welcome to join.
